There are still some things to be done.

# Figures

- [ ] Make a plot for the abundance vs. EP and RW. Both at convergence, and off convergence
- [x] The overview plots need bigger font and
    - [x] Fig. 1 measured linelist --> EW measurements
    - [x] Fig. 1 Atmosphere model Kurucz --> Grid of models
    - [x] Fig. 2 interpolate --> interpolate new model
- [x] Make a plot of new parameters vs. old parameters
- [x] Adjust font size on all plots
- [x] Find a good colourscheme for plots
- [ ] Stellar parameters affect on planetary parameters (is this out of the scope of the work?)

# Other stuff

- [ ] Add more text in the introduction. Look into some proposals for inspiration.
- [ ] Expand the result section
- [ ] Write the conclusion section
- [ ] Make sure the acknowledgement are right
- [ ] More on abundance section
